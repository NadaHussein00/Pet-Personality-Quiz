# 🐾PETSONA🐾
It is a quiz web app that identifies the unique personality of a pet based on user inputs. 

## What does it do? 
 It allows users to create profiles, take quizzes about their pets, view past quiz results, and update their answers to better understand their pet’s traits.
## What is the "new feature" which you have implemented that we haven't seen before? 

Identifying the pet's personality based on the user's options. Each option maps to a certain trait, and each trait has a score which then contributes to a dominant trait.

## Project Checklist
✅ It is available on GitHub.

✅ It uses the Flask web framework.

✅ It uses at least one module from the Python Standard Library other than the random module.

    🔴 Please provide the name of the module you are using in your app.

        ➡️ Module name: urllib.parse

        ➡️ Module name: datetime

        ➡️ Module name: html

        ➡️ Module name: json


✅ It contains at least one class written by you that has 
both properties and methods. It uses `__init__()` to let the 
class initialize the object's attributes (note that 
`__init__()` doesn't count as a method). This includes 
instantiating the class and using the methods in your app. 
Please provide below the file name and the line number(s) of 
at least one example of a class definition in your code as 
well as the names of two properties and two methods.

    ➡️ File name for the class definition: app/models/quiz_class.py
    
    ➡️ Line number(s) for the class definition: line 10 : line 88
    
    ➡️ Name of two properties: questions and descriptions
    
    ➡️ Name of two methods: load_questions and get_questions
    
    ➡️ File name and line numbers where the methods are used: file name -> app/models/quiz_class.py and line numbers -> line 19 : line 71
✅ It makes use of JavaScript in the front end and uses the 
localStorage of the web browser.

✅ It uses modern JavaScript (for example, let and const 
rather than var).

✅ It makes use of the reading and writing to the same file 
feature.

✅ It contains conditional statements. Please provide below 
the file name and the line number(s) of at leaste one example of a conditional statement in your code.

    📝For Python:

    ➡️ File name: app/utils/validate_signup_form.py
    ➡️ Function: validate_password function in app/utils/validate_signup_form.py 
    ➡️ Line number(s): line 54 : line 71

    📝For JavaScript:

    ➡️ File name: static/js/user_profile.js
    ➡️ Line number(s): line 33 : line 43

✅ It contains loops. Please provide below the file name 
and the line number(s) of at least
 one example of a loop in your code.
 
    📝For Python:

    ➡️ File name: app/models/trial_quiz_class.py
    ➡️ Function: calculate_scores function in app/models/trial_quiz_class.py 
    ➡️ Line number(s): line 17 : line 32

    📝For JavaScript:

    ➡️ File name: static/js/show_quizzes_history.js
    ➡️ Function: calculate_scores function in app/utils/validate_signup_form.py
    ➡️ Line number(s): line 63 : line 178

✅ It lets the user enter a value in a text box at some 
point.
 This value is received and processed by your back end 
Python code.

✅ It doesn't generate any error message even if the user 
enters a wrong input.

✅ It is styled using your own CSS.

✅ The code follows the code and style conventions as 
introduced in the course, is fully documented using comments 
and doesn't contain unused or experimental code. 
 In particular, the code should not use `print()` or 
`console.log()` for any information the app user should see. 
Instead, all user feedback needs to be visible in the 
browser. 

✅ All exercises have been completed as per the 
requirements and pushed to the respective GitHub repository.
